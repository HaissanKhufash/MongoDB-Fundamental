db.Premier_League.update(
    {
        _id: "645677b60b0de0477cce634"
    },
    {
        $set: 
        {
            team: "Newcastle United",
            'Kit colors': 'Black and white',
            titles: 4,
            'Current manager': 'Eddie Howe'
        }
    },
    {
        upsert: true
    }
)
If exists no document with 645677b60b0de0477cce634 as an _id, it will be created with the data passed as update
info.
That's why it's known as upsert (Update or insert...)
