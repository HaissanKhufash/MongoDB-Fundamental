- Cursor: allows us to see some queries, when we carry a query out, the cursor stays in the last one and, if we
require to see other logs we can set the cursor to do it.
- Projection: When we carry a query out, projections allow us to set which fields will be shown when the query
finds the results.
i.e.
db.collectionName.find(
    {"firstField": {$gt: 18}}, ==> range filter -you might use whether kind of filter.
    {"secondField": 1, "thirdField": 1} => projection, only it'll show the defined fields (1 to show, otherwise 0)
).limit(5) ==> logs to show
