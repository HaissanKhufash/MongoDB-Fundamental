- It's a document-oriented DBMS in which every log is stored in a JSON document.
JavaScript is the query language by default.
- Documents are constituted by fields.
- Documents are grouped by collections.
- This one use dynamic schemes:
    Allows to create no defined structure collections (different structures in the same section).

=> Access to a collection:
    DBName.collectionName
        Content be like:
        JSONDocument...
        JSONDocument...
        JSONDocument...
        JSONDocument...
        They're JSON files known as "documents", in which everyone is identified by the "_id" field,
        thence values must be unique.
